# Static Comp Challenge

## Overview
The goal of this project was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. As a developer building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is essential. We were given the freedom to choose the content and alter the color scheme as long as it was a complementary color palette. This comp buildout consisted of purely HTML and CSS, which allowed me to practice these skills and learn quite a bit. I gained much more knowledge about CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox, as well as many CSS styling features, CSS normalize and CSS reset. This project also allowed me to strengthen my implementation of web accessability and media queries for a responsive design on all screen sizes. I was able to unleash my creativity and heavlily strengthen my knowledge of CSS and HTML throughout this entire project.
